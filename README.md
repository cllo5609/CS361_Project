# Ski-Resort-Web-Application

A web application that gives current information on different Colorado ski areas. This information includes current weather,
map of the area and information about the mountain itself. This information is retrieved using microservices that perform web
scraping and weather APIs. Requests are made in the form of a text file and returned to a user using a seperate text file.
